          <h2 class="caseser">Problem</h2>
          <p style="text-align:left;">One of the renowned wireless telecommunication service providers from the US had over 25 call centers employing over ten thousand customer support executive. What their portal lacked was fine reporting capabilities, automation, and integration with the billing system. Also, opportunities prevail for improving the speed and efficiency of which the forms can be completed by customer support representatives to improvise call response time (CRT).</p>

		<div class="col-md-4 text-center">
			<h2 class="caseser">RiVi’s Contribution</h2>
		<p style="text-align:left;">In this regard, RiVi’s contribution was to ensure delivery management, program management, application design, architecture, business analysis, quality assurance. The strategy behind this was to enable transactions via back-end integration where most of the input and processing jobs were taken by the system itself.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4 text-center">
			<h2 class="caseser">Benefits</h2>
			<p style="text-align:left;">This approach helped in consolidating over 10 application windows into one portal to have access to customer data in a better way and reduce an average of 20 seconds of engagement from each form. This initiative has $5.1 MM NPV by Q4 2007.</p>
