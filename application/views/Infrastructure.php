				<h3><b>Storage & Backup</b></h3>
				<p class="pc">Business today depends hugely on IT Infrastructures for higher productivity and competitive advantage, hence it’s understood why data protection and its recovery become the essentials of everyday business operations.

When it comes to designing the storage strategy for an organization, the right technology must be relied upon in order to create primary storage systems, implement concrete backup procedures and ensure that the deployed solutions are managed uninterruptedly. Customers in the present day, invest in protecting and quick recovery of their valuable data by taking into account various kinds of approaches. Hence, there are some factors that affect these Infrastructure and policy decisions that need to be attended to. These include the cost of downtime, backup windows, time-to-recover, the frequency of backups, maturity of technological options, etc.</p>
				<p class="pc">RiVi can impart a win-win strategy for your storage and backup which will not only work to optimize and balance the cost of implementation but will also hold the risk at its minimum.</p>
