This benefitted the customer in evaluating the weaknesses and determining how their business strategies affected the operations and their amalgamation in the vision and mission of the organisation. Information from various disparate systems was collected into a data warehouse, architected specifically to provide scalable, high performance and accurate information, 24x7. This information was presented in an easy-to-access, secure web based format to employees with different security access levels. Information was presented via dashboards and reports, integrated into a common infrastructure called Trans Portal, which in turn was integrated with customer’s Intranet. </p>

		- More manpower required to produce manually<br>
		- More time wasted in manual gathering, compiling, creation and distribution of reports<br>
		- Manual calculations often render in erroneous data<br>
		- Data is deemed outdated by the time reports are distributed<br>
		- Historical data is archived in many cases, making it unavailable or difficult to obtain for reporting and analysis<br>

RiVi was involved in the entire life cycle of the project, from gathering requirements, conducting user information sessions, documenting existing business processes, designing the warehouse and portal architecture, system architecture, ETL architecture, selection of hardware and software tools, establishing infrastructure, setting up various work environments, development, quality control, changing management and rollover to production. The project was implemented in phases with key dashboards and reporting systems being integrated in each phase. The following defined the hardware and software environment:</p>

	<p>Alerts and indicators of “hot spots” are provided based on complex activities.</p><br>
	<p>Data entry is automated, reducing data processing time. The data warehouse portal is also integrated with the intranet web-site.</p><br>
