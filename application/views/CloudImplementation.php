	 				<p class="pc">Cloud computing is a completely different stroke as compared to conventional outsourcing methods.  It isolates your data from the usual IT infrastructure and stores it to a much safe and robust storage termed as “cloud”. This cloud storage is accessible from anywhere. And all this makes cloud computing the next big thing in IT and outsourcing arena.  With cloud implementation, we cover services like cost analysis, compliance, migration strategy, dealing with downtime and data migration.</p>
	 				<p class="pc">Here, the application, the operating system used as well as the hardware will be owned by the service provider. The cloud subscription provides you access to add or remove your data from the cloud anytime on the go.</p>

 			   	 <h3><b>Benefits</b></h3>
	 				  <ul  class="pc">
	 					<li>Diligence: In terms of the cloud computing era, there is an ever-expanding system which offers us chances to learn from. So, it would be adequate to educate the internal stakeholders and take technical assistance when required.</li>
	 					<li>Attention to security: Data security has always been the primary concern to stakeholders. What cloud implementation offers is an increased level of internal scrutiny and data resiliency.</li>
	 					<li>Alteration in dynamics: Contracts for cloud services are completely different from outsourcing contracts. Cloud contracts are flexible with time and changes while outsourcing sticks to a strict timeline.</li>
	 					<li>Business adjustments: Cloud implementation is a crucial concept that demands a different governance and administrative approach. The synchronization of how solutions get selected and further implemented plays a major role in cloud implementation.</li>
	 					<li>Integration plan: For a conglomerate IT environment and to serve a diverse vendor base, we have come up with expansive approaches. Strategizing an integration plan is a critical job but with our team at RiVi, we are making it go possible.
                   </li>
