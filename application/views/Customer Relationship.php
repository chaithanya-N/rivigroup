          <p style="text-align:left;">RiVi help develop Customer’s Trans Portal – which is a data warehouse and business intelligence portal that acts as a one stop destination for all of the enterprise’s real-time performance monitoring and reporting needs. This helps customer in evaluating its weaknesses and how its business strategies are affecting its operations and how it all ties in to the vision and mission of the organization. Information from many disparate systems is collected into a data warehouse – architected specifically to provide scalable, high performance and available information 24×7. This information is presented in an easy-to-access secure web based format to employees with different security access levels. Information is presented via Dashboards and Reports integrated into a common infrastructure called Trans Portal, which in turn is integrated with customer’s Intranet.</p>

			<h2 class="caseser">Problem Information Challenges faced by customer</h2>
		<p style="text-align:left;">- Access to real-time and accurate information by Executives and Management<br>
		- Generation of reports from a variety of disparate systems across the Enterprise<br>
		- Analysis of how the business is performing across different functional areas<br>
		- Correlation of different business events<br>
		- Understanding how business events impact the customers, and how the goals of increasing revenue, profitability and increased rider ship are affected<br>
		- Making better business decisions to achieve business objectives.</p>

			<h2 class="caseser">Existing state of IT systems and challenges for information delivery</h2>
						<p style="text-align:left;">- Inconsistent Data from multiple data sources including manual entry, mainframe systems, VSAM, Unidata, MS Access, MS Word, Oracle files, Excel spreadsheets, Legacy Systems and others.<br>
			- Multiple systems store similar data but in different formats and using different business rules causing data redundancy and inconsistency and making it hard to correlate information.<br>
			- Several full-time dedicated staff needed to produce reports manually.<br>
			- Hours repeatedly wasted in manual gathering, compilation, creation and distribution of reports.<br>
			- Manual calculations è erroneous data<br>
			- Data is outdated by the time reports are distributed.<br>
			- Historical data is archived in many cases making it unavailable or difficult to obtain for reporting and analysis.<br>
			- Lack of enough, accurate, timely, summarized and correlated information creates an environment for potentially non-optimal business decisions.<br>
			- Outdated and manual business processes.<br>
			- No drill down capability to lower level details without complex coding</p>

          <p style="padding:10px;">To resolve the problems listed above, the customer embarked upon a long-term data warehouse initiative and chose RiVi — for its core expertise in that area — to help with the implementation of the system. RiVi was involved in the entire life cycle of the project, from gathering requirements, conducting user information sessions, documenting existing business processes, designing the warehouse and portal architecture, system architecture, ETL architecture, selection of hardware and software tools, establishing infrastructure, setting up various work environments, development, quality control, changing management and rollover to production. The project was implemented in phases with key dashboards and reporting systems being integrated in each phase. The following defined the hardware and software environment:</p>

	<p>Through the implementation of an Enterprise Data Warehouse and Web Portal, decision makers no longer have to deal with raw data: data from diverse legacy systems is standardized, integrated and presented in an easy-to-use online format accessible via a web browser.</p><br>
	<p>Access to real-time information on bus and rail performance, quality, safety, customer complaints, crime rates, staffing and financial aspects is supported with drill-down and drill-through functionality.</p><br>
	<p>Managers are presented with indicators that provide an overview of current performance and activities</p><br>
	<p>Alerts and indicators of “hot spots” are provided based on complex activities.</p><br>
	<p>Data entry is automated, reducing data processing time. The data warehouse portal is also integrated with the intranet web-site.</p><br>
	<p>RiVi also made recommendations for the future phases and how the existing data warehouse could further be enhanced to help the customer achieve its business goals.</p><br>
	<p  style="text-align:center;font-size:20px;"> <b>Results</b></p><br>
	<p>“Receiving up-to-date and timely information is critical in making effective decisions.
